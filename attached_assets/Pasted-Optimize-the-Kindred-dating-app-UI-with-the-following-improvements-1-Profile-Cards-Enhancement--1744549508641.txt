Optimize the Kindred dating app UI with the following improvements:

1. Profile Cards Enhancement:

   - Increase profile photo size for better visibility
   - Make the "I love fish and chips" bio text more prominent to highlight personality

   - Include a "Preferred Call Times" section on each profile card with a simple visual indicator (e.g., small clock icon with time ranges)
   - Add an X/refresh icon in the top right corner of each match card for the swap/unmatch feature

2. Navigation Improvements:
   - Make the currently selected tab more distinctive (Matches is selected but barely highlighted)
   - Increase spacing between bottom navigation icons for easier tapping
   - Add labels below all navigation icons for clarity

3. Action Buttons:
   - Make the Call/Chat/View buttons more visually appealing with subtle colors that align with the brand
   - Increase button size slightly for better tappability on mobile
   - Add hover/active states for better interaction feedback
   - Enhance the Call button to show compatibility with the user's preferred call times (e.g., "Available Now" or "Prefers Evening Calls")

4. Subscription Elements:
   - Make the "Upgrade" button more prominent with brand colors
   - Enhance the "Basic Plan" indicator with a more polished design that clearly shows limitations
   - Consider adding a brief benefit for upgrading (e.g., "Unlock unlimited matches")

5. Header Optimization:
   - Refine the welcome message area to be more engaging
   - Consider adding a quick action button for finding new matches

6. Preferred Call Times Feature:
   - Design an intuitive time selection interface for users to set weekday and weekend availability
   - Display preferred call times on profiles using a clean, scannable format (e.g., "Weekdays: 7-9 PM, Weekends: 2-5 PM")
   - Use color coding to indicate current availability status (green for "Available Now", amber for "Available Soon", gray for "Unavailable")
   - Add a small calendar view option to see weekly availability at a glance
   - Include a "Schedule Call" option that automatically suggests times within both users' preferred windows

7. Match Swap/Unmatch Feature:
   - Implement a refresh/X icon in the top right corner of each match card
   - For premium users: When clicked, replace the current match with a new potential match if available; otherwise, unmatch
   - For basic plan users: When clicked, display an "Upgrade to Premium" modal explaining this feature is only available to premium members
   - Add a subtle animation for the card replacement to provide visual feedback
   - Include a small undo button that appears briefly after swapping/unmatching
   - Implement a confirmation dialog before unmatching to prevent accidental removals

Implement these changes while maintaining the app's purple brand color and overall minimalist aesthetic. Ensure all elements follow accessibility guidelines with sufficient contrast ratios.
